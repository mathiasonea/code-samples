# Dear ladies and gentlemen!

During my commercial development within the last years, I have created a lot of projects which unfortunately can't be disclosed just like that to your company. But I have taken out some parts which are quite generic, in order for you to get a rough understanding of my code style.

Please find those examples within the src folder of this repository.
> Note: the code examples withing the `./src` folder are taken out of different Laravel projects and therefore not executable due to the different namespaces, etc. They are only meant to serve demonstration purposes.

Furthermore, I have contributed/co-created some open source content which is publicly available and listed in the following:

This is a small but handy package to prevent malicious code execution coming into your application through uploaded images.
It was created after being inspired by [@appelsiini](https://github.com/appelsiini)'s [talk on How to Hack your Laravel Application](https://speakerdeck.com/anamus/how-your-laravel-application-can-get-hacked-f7acca32-3721-4c06-9a2e-5965cd9a4a29)
